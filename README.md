# README

This is the test code for https://github.com/datarockets/career/blob/master/jobs/ruby/test-task.md

###### few comments:
- impossible to use `type` in column or class names. I used `event_type`.
- `User` model added because we have to know who should receive an email notification
- `User` and `Post.author` can be different
- A lot of additional things can be added here: more pages, styles, functionality, tests.
